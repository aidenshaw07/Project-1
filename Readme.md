Major Hurdles:

Even though functionality of the game works perfectly fine, there's one minor bug which I am still trying to fix. When the game gives the user the same color back to back as the game pattern, the colored pad supposed to blink two times but right now it only blink once for longer than it should. Still a work in progress.
